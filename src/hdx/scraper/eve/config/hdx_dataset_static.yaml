methodology: A more detailed FAO EVE user manual, including detailed methodology, will be published soon.
caveats: |
  EVE analyses are based on global datasets to ensure broad coverage, rapid scalability, and integration into international humanitarian workflows. However, these datasets cannot always capture national or local specificities that would enhance analytical precision.

  While EVE can estimate the extent of flooded cropland, it does not determine whether the affected cropland was actively cultivated at the time of the flood.

  EVE does not inherently differentiate between hazardous and non-hazardous floods, which can lead to false detections in agricultural regions. Some flood events result from regular seasonal patterns or controlled agricultural activities, such as rice paddy planting or aquaculture, rather than actual hazard-related floods.

notes: |
  The DIEM Events Visualization in Emergencies (EVE) system provides resources to enhance the understanding of flood events and their impact on different land cover types, with a particular focus on agricultural areas. EVE provides a flood persistence analysis as well as an estimation of the population exposed to such events.

  EVE utilizes satellite-derived data from the NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) at a 375-meter resolution, alongside land cover data from the European Space Agencyâ€™s WorldCover 10m 2021 dataset. Covering approximately 40 countries, the system offers daily and biweekly insights, providing a continuously updated view of flood dynamics and their effects.

  The platform presents results through interactive maps, charts, and tables, supporting decision-making in disaster management, agricultural planning, and environmental monitoring. Most resources are publicly accessible, though downloading aggregated data at the admin2 level requires a [DIEM account](https://hqfao.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/oauth2/signup?client_id=aEXLMtXxljlIrgPN&response_type=token&expiration=20160&showSocialLogins=true&locale=en-us&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-in-emergencies.fao.org%2Ftorii-provider-arcgis%2Fhub-redirect.html).

  EVE products are preliminary analyses and have not yet undergone field validation. Users are encouraged to provide ground feedback to the [FAO Data in Emergencies (DIEM) team](https://data-in-emergencies.fao.org/pages/contactus) to enhance the accuracy and utility of the data.
